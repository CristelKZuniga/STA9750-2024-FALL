<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to Mini-Project. The following analysis will examine the U.S. public transit systems, using data from the National Transit Database (NTD), I explore different aspects of the transit systems, from ridership trends and vehicle usage mode, to financial performance indicators such as farebox recovery ratios. The purpose of this analysis is to reveal the most efficient systems, and provide a comprehensive view of how different modes—such as buses, rail, and vanpool—are utilized across the country.</p>
<p>The database analyzed in this site has been substracted from: - <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> - <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> - <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a></p>

<p>#Last question: The most efficient transit system in the country, in my opinion, is The Transit Authority of Central Kentucky by #Vanpool, which boasts the highest recovery ratio in the country at $2.38 USD. My basis for declaring this system efficient #is its high recovery cost, as indicated by the ratio, which could lead one to think that this transit #system is profitable. Nevertheless, Vanpool is a mode of transportation that could be slow due to external factors, such as traffic, accidents, and other road conditions.</p>
