This project is presented by the **Listing Legends** team. We decided to analyze Airbnb trends because we heard news about new laws being applied to listings in New York, which we found interesting since New York is one of the top tourist attractions in the world. Additionally, we discovered an interesting fact from [10 Fun Facts You Didn’t Know](https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/10-airbnb-facts-didnt-know): in 2020, when COVID-19 first started, the Airbnb business declined significantly, but within two months, its business model rebounded, proving its adaptability to new travel trends.

In this report you will find information related with one of the specific question: **Length of stay effect on the listing price and reviews.**

## Installing libraries

First, let's start by gathering all the necessary libraries for Analysis and visualization.

<details>

```{r}

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("caret")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

## Downloading NYC databases for 2019 and 2023.

Datasets were sourced from *Kaggle.*

[NYC Airbnb 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H9bgJZVhN8Y5orbzU4wSWMKJf7YE474W/view?usp=drive_link)

[NYC Airbnb 2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bBBjZ5_Rmj21wsMvzEFveNzhhNsD3Qs/view?usp=drive_link)

Databases are stored in Google Drive, and we are using the google drive package for authentication and connection to the account, as well as downloading the databases.

<details>

<summary>Initial code to download the databases</summary>

```{r}
# Install and load the googledrive package if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("googledrive", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("googledrive")
}

library(googledrive)

# Authenticate and connect to Google Drive
drive_auth()

# Specify the file ID from the Google Drive link
file_id <- "1H9bgJZVhN8Y5orbzU4wSWMKJf7YE474W"

# Download the file from Google Drive
drive_download(as_id(file_id), path = "NYC-Airbnb-2019.csv", overwrite = TRUE)

df_2019 <- read.csv("NYC-Airbnb-2019.csv")
head(df_2019)
View(df_2019)
```

```{r}

# Authenticate and connect to Google Drive
drive_auth()

# Specify the file ID from the Google Drive link
file_id <- "1_bBBjZ5_Rmj21wsMvzEFveNzhhNsD3Qs"

# Download the file from Google Drive
drive_download(as_id(file_id), path = "NYC-Airbnb-2023.csv", overwrite = TRUE)

df_2023 <- read.csv("NYC-Airbnb-2023.csv")
View(df_2023)
```

</details>

## Cleaning and Pre processingIn this step, we ensured all missing values were removed from both databases.

I also hot-coded dummy variables using the `dummyVars` function. This was applied to *Room Type* and *Neighborhood Group* to allow flexibility in analyzing these groups independently.

Next, we removed outliers to ensure the analysis was not skewed by extreme values that might not represent typical trends or behaviors in the dataset. For example, in the case of the variable *price*, outliers could distort averages and lead to misleading conclusions about standard pricing patterns.

Lastly, we renamed all the columns to ensure the plots and tables are displayed in a clear and organized format.

<summary>Handle missing values</summary>

  )


library(dplyr)

df_2023 <- df_2023 %>%

### Define the target variable and features.

To begin addressing this question, we analyzed the feature importances that most impacted the price of NYC listings in 2019 and 2023. To do this, we split the data into training sets and trained the model using tree-based methods under regression analysis.

The code below shows the division of the target variables. I would like to note here that, exclusively for this analysis, we utilized Google Colab and Python as the programming language. The reason for this was that I initially attempted to run the same analysis in R Studio but was unsuccessful. Therefore, I decided to complete the task using a different programming language. Below, you will find a screenshot of the code.

<details>

<summary>Code to see the target Variables</summary>

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide',warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE, cache.lazy=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fold=TRUE}
#2019 database
# Define the target variable
y_2019 <- df_2019$Price

# Define the feature set by selecting all columns except the specified ones
X_2019 <- df_2019 %>%
  select(-Price, -`Airbnb Name`, -`Host Name`)

# Print the dimensions of the feature set and target variable
cat("Feature set shape:", dim(X_2019), "\n")
cat("Target shape:", length(y_2019), "\n")



```

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide',warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE, cache.lazy=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fold=TRUE}


#2023 database
# Define the target variable
y_2023 <- df_2023$Price

# Define the feature set by selecting all columns except the specified ones
X_2023 <- df_2023 %>%
  select(-Price, -`Airbnb Name`, -`Host Name`)

# Print the dimensions of the feature set and target variable
cat("Feature set shape:", dim(X_2023), "\n")
cat("Target shape:", length(y_2023), "\n")

## Most important Features impacting the Airbnb Prices in 2019 and 2023.

With this analysis, we were able to identify the features with the highest importance in the price changes for listings in 2019 and 2023.

#### 2019 Feature Importance

![](Important feature 2019.png)

In 2019, the price was primarily driven by the **room type**, followed by the **location**, with Airbnbs in Manhattan being the most popular. Homes and apartments were the top rental choices.

#### 2023 Feature Importance

![](important feature 2023.png)

In 2023, the behavior changed as the number of reviews became a significant factor in driving rental prices. Homes and apartments remained the dominant room types, and Manhattan continued to be a prime location. However, reviews from other renters have now become very important.

Two crucial factors that could have influenced this change are the 2020 global pandemic and customers’ increased search for cleaner and safer spaces. They can only corroborate this information through the ratings and reviews of previous renters. A second factor is a new law enforced last year, which prohibits owners from renting full apartments for less than 30 days in New York City.

## Analysis: **4. Length of stay effect on the listing price and reviews.**

To continue with this analysis, I aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of the previously obtained results. To achieve this, I considered various ways to cross-validate the information, such as comparing changes year-to-year or variable-to-variable.

-   Comparison of changes in the number of minimum nights allowed between 2019 and 2023.

-   Distribution of price changes from 2019 to 2023.

-   Distribution of price changes, summarizing only the top 20 listings with the highest increase in minimum nights year-to-year: this provides a closer approach.

-   Changes in the number of reviews and reviews per month from 2019 to 2023: this could offer additional insights.

-   Correlation between price changes, number of reviews, and minimum nights.

### Change comparison on the Number on minimum number of nights allowed in 2019 and 2023.

In this approach, I extracted the target columns for analysis from both datasets and merged them. I then calculated the number of days with an increase or decrease in the minimum nights for hosts who were registered in 2019 and remained active in 2023. Next, I classified these values into bins of 10 days each. Finally, I created a heatmap for better visualization.

<details>

```{r}
# Rename and extract relevant columns for 2019
min_nights_2019 <- df_2019 %>%
  select(`Host ID`, `Minimum Nights`) %>%
  group_by(`Host ID`) %>%
  summarize(`Min Nights 2019` = mean(`Minimum Nights`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Rename and extract relevant columns for 2023
min_nights_2023 <- df_2023 %>%
  select(`Host ID`, `Minimum Nights`) %>%
  group_by(`Host ID`) %>%
  summarize(`Min Nights 2023` = mean(`Minimum Nights`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Merge both datasets
merged_min_nights <- merge(min_nights_2019, min_nights_2023, by = "Host ID", all = FALSE)

# Calculate the difference
merged_min_nights$`Min Nights Change` <- merged_min_nights$`Min Nights 2023` - merged_min_nights$`Min Nights 2019`

# Analyze the results
summary(merged_min_nights)

```

```{r}

# Count the number of unique Host IDs
unique_host_ids_count <- length(unique(merged_min_nights$`Host ID`))

# Print the result
cat(sprintf("Number of unique Host IDs: %d\n", unique_host_ids_count))


```

```{r}

# Hosts with increased minimum nights
increased_min_nights <- merged_min_nights[merged_min_nights$`Min Nights Change` > 0, ]
#print(increased_min_nights)

# Hosts with decreased minimum nights
decreased_min_nights <- merged_min_nights[merged_min_nights$`Min Nights Change` < 0, ]
#print(decreased_min_nights)


```

```{r}
# Define bins for changes (10-day intervals)
bins <- c(-Inf, seq(-120, 120, by = 10), Inf)

# Define labels for bins
labels <- c(
  paste0(seq(-120, 110, by = 10), " to ", seq(-110, 120, by = 10)),
  "> 120 days", "< -120 days"
)

# Create a new column with 10-day bins
merged_min_nights$`Change Group` <- cut(
  merged_min_nights$`Min Nights Change`,
  breaks = bins,
  labels = labels,
  include.lowest = TRUE
)

# Display the first few rows to check
head(merged_min_nights)



```

```{r}
# Group by 'Change Group' and count
grouped_changes <- merged_min_nights %>%
  group_by(`Change Group`) %>%

# Add a dummy column for a single-row heatmap
grouped_changes <- grouped_changes %>%
  mutate(Dummy = "Hosts")  # Create a dummy column for the x-axis

# Plot the heatmap with counts displayed
ggplot(data = grouped_changes, aes(x = Dummy, y = `Change Group`, fill = Count)) +
  geom_tile(color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Count), color = "white", size = 4) +  # Add labels
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "purple", name = "Number of Hosts") +

    title = "Heatmap of Minimum Nights Changes (2019 to 2023)",

### Heatmap of Minimum Night Changes (2019 - 2023)

Per the previous analysis, the variable "Minimum Nights" was one of the major factors in the price change in 2023. After reviewing our data, we found that the average minimum nights on Airbnb listings increased from 4.85 nights (2019) to 16.66 nights (2023). In the plot below, we can see that out of the 13,980 total listings found in both datasets, half of them increased their required minimum stay to between 30 and 40 days.

![](Heatmap1.png)

## Price Change Distribution of 2019 and 2023

Now, I wanted to illustrate this change in dollars. To do this, I extracted the target variables, specifically *Host ID* and *Price*, merged them into a new dataframe, and calculated the price change percentage from 2019 to 2023, whether it was a decrease or an increase. Finally, I used a bar graph for better visualization.

<details>

```{r}
# Drop duplicate Host IDs, keeping the first occurrence
df_2019_unique <- df_2019 %>% distinct(`Host ID`, .keep_all = TRUE)
df_2023_unique <- df_2023 %>% distinct(`Host ID`, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Merge with the merged_min_nights dataframe
merged_min_nights <- merged_min_nights %>%
  left_join(select(df_2019_unique, `Host ID`, `Price`), by = "Host ID") %>%
  rename(Price_2019 = Price) %>%
  left_join(select(df_2023_unique, `Host ID`, `Price`), by = "Host ID") %>%
  rename(Price_2023 = Price)

# Calculate the price change
merged_min_nights <- merged_min_nights %>%
  mutate(
    Price_Change = Price_2023 - Price_2019,
    Price_Change_Percent = ((Price_2023 - Price_2019) / Price_2019) * 100
  )

# View the first few rows of the resulting dataframe
head(merged_min_nights)

```

```{r}
# Define bins for the percentage change (e.g., -100% to 100% in 10% increments)
bins_percentage <- seq(-100, 100, by = 10)
labels_percentage <- paste(bins_percentage[-length(bins_percentage)], "% to ", bins_percentage[-1] - 1, "%", sep = "")

# Categorize into bins for price change
merged_min_nights$Price_Change_Group <- cut(
  merged_min_nights$Price_Change_Percent,
  breaks = bins_percentage,
  labels = labels_percentage,
  include.lowest = TRUE
)

# Group by Price Change Group and count the number of listings
price_change_grouped <- merged_min_nights %>%
  count(Price_Change_Group) %>%
  arrange(Price_Change_Group)

# Plotting the price change distribution
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(price_change_grouped, aes(x = Price_Change_Group, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple", color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Price Change Distribution (2019 to 2023)",
    x = "Price Change Group (%)",
    y = "Number of Listings"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "gray"))


```

</details>

The goal of this analysis is to review the change in behavior in comparison with the change in minimum nights. As we can observe, 41.77% of listings registered in 2019 and 2023 maintained almost the same price. According to previous research, the new Law 18 affected many owners monetarily, as the length of stay increased. Fewer tourists can afford a long stay, which led owners to offer slight discounts or promotions to keep their business running.

![](Price Change Distribution.png)

## Top 20 Listings with the larger Minimum Night Change from 2019 to 2023

Now, from the previous dataframe, we selected the top 20 listings with the highest minimum night changes and created a visualization using a scatter plot. I found this type of graph very helpful because it clearly shows how the change occurred over these two years and is easy to interpret.

<details>

```{r}
# Get the top 20 listings with the highest increase in minimum nights
top_50_min_nights_increase <- merged_min_nights %>%
  arrange(desc(`Min Nights Change`)) %>%
  head(20)

# View the top 20 listings
head(top_50_min_nights_increase, 15)


```

```{r}

# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Minimum Nights Change and Price Change
ggplot(top_50_min_nights_increase, aes(x = `Min Nights Change`, y = `Price_Change`, color = `Price_Change`, size = `Price_Change`)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 10)) +  # Adjust the size range for better visibility
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("blue", "red")) +  # Coolwarm color palette approximation
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Minimum Nights Change and Price Change",
    x = "Change in Minimum Nights",
    y = "Price Change (Monetary)",
    color = "Price Change (%)",
    size = "Price Change (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")  # Adjust legend position


```

</details>

In this analysis, we selected the top 20 listings with the greatest increase in length of stay. As expected, most of the listings show a \$0 change or a decrease in price.

![](top20.png)

## No. Reviews and Reviews per Month Change from 2019 to 2023

The next approach I wanted to explore is the change in the number of reviews from one year to another, considering that factors like COVID or the new law might have an effect.

Firstly, we pull the target variables and merge them into a dataframe, then we proceed to calculate the change in numbers from one year to the next. But the results didn't go as expected, there is not a high change, my expectation was that the change was way higher.

<details>

```{r}
# Ensure necessary libraries are loaded
library(dplyr)

# Remove duplicates by Host ID in both 2019 and 2023 data frames
df_2019_unique <- df_2019 %>% distinct(`Host ID`, .keep_all = TRUE)
df_2023_unique <- df_2023 %>% distinct(`Host ID`, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Add 'No. Reviews' and 'Reviews/Month' from df_2019 and df_2023 into merged_min_nights
merged_min_nights <- merged_min_nights %>%

```{r}
# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(merged_min_nights, aes(x = `Min Nights Change`, y = `No. Reviews Change`)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +  # Plot points in blue

Our third approach is to compare and analyze the relationship between Minimum Nights Change and the number of reviews change to determine if there is a significant correlation suggesting that changes in minimum nights directly affect the number of reviews per listing. Most data points are concentrated around zero on both axes, indicating that many listings experienced minimal or no change in either variable.

## Correlation Price Change vs. No. Reviews & Minimum Nights Change

Finally, I wanted to globalize these different analyses in relation to the price (we previously did this with the Minimum Nights, but the Number of Reviews was not analyzed). So, we pulled the price change dataframe, the number of reviews, and minimum nights change dataframes, then merged them into a correlation matrix.

<details>

```{r}
# Get the top 20 listings with the highest increase in minimum nights
top_20_min_nights_increase <- merged_min_nights %>%
  arrange(desc(`Min Nights Change`)) %>%
  head(20)

# View the top 3 of the top 20
head(top_20_min_nights_increase, 3)

```

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide',warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache = TRUE, cache.lazy=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fold=TRUE}
# Ensure necessary libraries are loaded
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(merged_min_nights[, c('Min Nights Change', 'Price_Change', 'No. Reviews Change')])

# Convert the correlation matrix to a long format for ggplot
correlation_matrix_melted <- melt(correlation_matrix)

# Plot the correlation matrix heatmap
ggplot(correlation_matrix_melted, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f", value)), color = "white", size = 5) +  # Add correlation values to tiles
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "purple", mid = "orange", midpoint = 0) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Between Minimum Nights Change, Price Change, and Reviews") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels

```

In conclusion, the change in the length of stay has had a notable impact on rental prices, particularly in 2023. As previously discussed, 50% of the listings increased their minimum nights requirement; however, these listings did not significantly raise their prices. Instead, many owners opted to keep prices stable or slightly reduce them, despite broader economic factors such as inflation and increased tourism. This suggests a strategic decision by owners to adopt a "low price" approach to attract more customers, likely in response to new Airbnb regulations and heightened consumer sensitivity to environmental and social challenges.

On the other hand, the change in the number of reviews showed only a slight increase in 2023 and did not appear to have a substantial impact on the minimum nights requirement. Ultimately, it is evident that price changes are more strongly influenced by adjustments in the Minimum Nights variable than by the number of reviews. This highlights the importance of length-of-stay policies as a key factor shaping Airbnb rental strategies in recent years.
